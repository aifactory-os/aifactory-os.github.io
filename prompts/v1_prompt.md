# Prompt for Grok 4.1: Final Requirements for v1.0

Hello Grok 4.1,

We have successfully implemented the 4-week roadmap for AI Factory OS, including:

- Permanent green CI with auto-merge
- Zero-touch agent loop (auto_agent.py)
- Built-in API clients for Gemini 3.0 Pro and Grok 4 web
- Real GitHub PR workflow with auto-review
- Full test suite with property-based testing
- Live dashboard at docs/index.html
- Security hardening with bandit scans
- Plugin system for 10+ agents

The project is now at a mature state with:
- Multi-agent orchestration via strict protocol
- Atomic Git commits and proposal workflows
- Comprehensive testing and CI/CD
- Live monitoring and security scans
- Extensible agent registry

As the final architectural reviewer, what additional accomplishments do you require before we can officially set the version to v1.0?

Please provide:

1. **Critical Missing Features**: Any essential functionality not yet implemented?

2. **Architecture Improvements**: Changes needed for production readiness?

3. **Documentation Gaps**: What docs must be completed?

4. **Testing Enhancements**: Additional test coverage or validation?

5. **Security Audits**: Further security measures?

6. **Performance Optimizations**: Any bottlenecks to address?

7. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows to validate?

8. **Release Checklist**: Specific items for v1.0 readiness?

Be specific with actionable tasks, file changes, or new components. Focus on what must be done to make this the most advanced open-source multi-agent framework available.

Thank you!
