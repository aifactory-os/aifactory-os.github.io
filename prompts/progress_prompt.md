# Prompt for Grok 4.1: How to Progress AI Factory OS Project

Hello Grok 4.1,

I am working on the AI Factory OS project, an open-source multi-agent software factory that enables Grok 4, Gemini 3.0 Pro, and local agents to collaborate on building production software using strict protocols, atomic Git commits, and automated workflows.

The project structure includes:

```
aifactory-os.github.io/
├── core/
│   ├── orchestrator.py
│   └── logger.py
├── agents/
│   └── registry.py
├── clients/
├── shared/
├── tasks/
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── prompts/
├── pyproject.toml
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

Current status: Actively developed as of Nov 2025. The framework supports:
- Grok Code Fast 1 for backend, quantization, training loops
- Gemini 3.0 Pro for UX, API design, documentation
- Grok 4.1 (web) for final architectural review
- Full Git history, auto-testing, proposal/merge workflow
- Ready for 10+ agents out of the box

To progress the project, I need comprehensive guidance on:

1. **Next Development Priorities**: What features or components should be developed next to enhance the multi-agent collaboration?

2. **Integration Strategies**: How to better integrate Grok 4, Gemini 3.0 Pro, and local agents for seamless workflow?

3. **Scalability Improvements**: Ways to scale the framework for larger projects or more agents?

4. **Testing and Validation**: Enhanced testing strategies for multi-agent interactions and Git-based workflows?

5. **Documentation and Onboarding**: Improving docs and making it easier for new contributors?

6. **Performance Optimizations**: Any bottlenecks in the current architecture and how to address them?

7. **Security Considerations**: Ensuring secure collaboration between different AI agents and human developers?

8. **Deployment and CI/CD**: Best practices for deploying and maintaining the framework?

Please provide detailed, actionable recommendations with specific code changes, new files, or architectural improvements where applicable. Focus on practical steps that can be implemented in the near term to advance the project.

Thank you!
